# sfsf

This is rough around the edges code for the proof of concept phase of the [Huygens Institute](http://huygens.knaw.nl) and [GEAData](http://www.geadata.nl/) project SFSF. For ethical and copyright reasons the aims and much of the contents of this project cannot yet be disclosed. The code however while being under development, is available. 

#### Notes

* If you run in trouble with the encoding of wpg_data.csv, open the Excel file it derived from and save it as format 'Windows Comma Separated (.csv)'.
